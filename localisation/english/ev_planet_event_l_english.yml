Then the entrance of this building should be very large and not difficult to find. Not to mention that there should be many windows and doors, ventilation and sewage pipes in a normal building. As long as one of these is found, the investigators of §H[Root.GetName]§! Can enter it. \n\nBut contrary to expectations, the scanner did not look for signs of such an entrance. The result of each excavation was that the pickaxe hit a smooth alloy shell. Is it completely closed? We may have to clear the pumice of a whole mountain before we can find the entrance to this building. This is not a small project. Besides, a lot of pumice is already formed into rocks, which further increases the difficulty of cleaning."

 ev_ancient_relics.2.desc:0 "The pumice has been completely cleared, so that we can get a glimpse of the whole picture of this artificial artifact. Surprisingly, this is not a building. It looks more like a starship. Great flagships can't match it. \n\n§H[Root.GetName]§! Investigators have made new discoveries after continued research. The ground at the bottom of the starship has had intense impact marks, forming a pothole called a basin. The lower half of the starship is buried deep underground. It can be seen that the starship hit the ground of §Y[event_target: ev_tomb_planet.GetName]§! For unknown reasons, but such a strong collision did not cause visible damage to the hull structure, and its sturdiness was amazing. \n\nIts entrance, which now seems to be called the hatch, has been found, and it takes a while to decipher the password."

 ev_ancient_relics.3.desc:0 "After entering the starship, the eye-catching scene shocked the investigators of §H[Root.GetName]§!: The fertile soil nourished the lush pastures, and the verdant grassy sea was so large that the atmospheric composition was mainly Nitrogen and oxygen suitable for breathing, an artificial sun hung in the sky. Not only that, there is an atmospheric circulation system with a complex and changing climate here! \n\nObviously, this is an interstellar Noah's ark. Its built-in ecosystem is huge and perfect, so that it can maintain a balanced operation after the starship falls. Dominant in this biosphere is a gigantic cloven-hoofed herbivore with large horns on its skull. After dissection, this animal was found to have four gastric chambers, three of which were differentiated from the esophagus. Scientists §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! It was concluded that this animal is a ruminant that can promote plant cellulose Digestion and absorption. \n\nThis species has primitive society and will create some basic tools. Civilization is probably in the Stone Age. Maybe they are the original owners of this starship, but the technology has fallen back to this point after the fall? Or is it just some kind of alien animal that is kept in the biological garden and has developed the society by itself after a long time after the owner died? It is unknown at this stage."

 ev_ancient_relics.4.desc:0 "Investigators of §H[Root.GetName]§! Began to search other cabins of the starship, and soon we ruled out that the herbivore was the original owner of the starship, because the instruments and daily necessities in these cabins were obvious Not designed for ungulates. \n\nAlthough the items in the cabin were damaged, they were not cluttered, and they were clearly organized. This shows that the original owners of the starship did not die because of the impact. Because of this, we can easily find the space log left by him in the captain's room. \n\nAccording to the preliminary deciphering content, this spaceship is named §Y"Star Raft"§!, which was built by the Venetians to neutralize power in other countries, and has the function of flagship and luxury cruise ships. The voyage was a its maiden voyage, inviting leaders and leaders from all countries to attend the banquet. \n\nThe kind of herbivorous animal named §H"Pifflo cow"§! is a livestock carefully cultivated by this civilization. Its meat is tender and delicious. As ingredients for banquets. \n\nA lot of questions can be explained clearly, but new questions follow: why all the bones found on the §YStar Raft§! came from the Pifflo cows, but the bones of the Venetti and other passengers Didn't find one?"

This kind of animal that will attract predators to fight themselves will soon be eliminated in nature. It is estimated that only genetic engineering can create this kind of creature. \n\nBecause the atmosphere inside the starship is suitable for breathing, most investigators have taken offensive gas masks in violation of regulations. These people were affected by pheromones, coveted Pifflo cows and couldn't concentrate on their work, which seriously slowed down the progress of the excavation of the site and the interpretation of the aerospace log. \n\nIn order to prevent the situation from further deteriorating, the scientist §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! decided to slaughter some Pifflo cows for all crew members to eat. \n\nBefore that, they tested the edible of Pifflo cattle. Because the environment in the biological park is very clean, no pathogenic microorganisms and parasites were found, and no toxin was detected. Animal experiments have been performed since then, and animals in the laboratory were fed with Peflo beef, and there were no adverse reactions. \n \nAfter ensuring foolproofness, the kitchen of the scientific research ship has been serving Pifflo beef cooking for several days in a row, and it is really delicious. Investigators are eager to celebrate, and the progress of archeology has also greatly improved. \n\nNote: Several investigators are missing and are conducting a search."

What's more terrible is that the laboratory animals have mutated, and those experimental animals that have been fed with Peflo beef have changed. They have horns on their heads, their claws have become hoofs, and they no longer eat meat. Although much smaller, everyone can see that this is a replica of the Pifflo. \n\nThe panic is spreading wildly on the scientific research ship. Everyone is in doubt. Will we also mutate? Everyone had the answer, but they didn't dare to say it, and they didn't want to face the truth. \n \nUntil the head chef found that the eyes of a freshly slaughtered Pefalloin were artificial prosthetic eyes, and its model was exactly the same as the model provided by Scout H[Root.GetName]§! for the Scout. The news was undoubtedly a blow to the boat, shattering the crew's precarious sense of security, and it was a time of fright. \n\nAlthough the scientist §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! decided to skip the useless content in the middle of the aerospace log and decipher the last chapters directly, it was ... useless ... \n\nAt this time, the alarm on the research ship suddenly sounded, and a large number of unknown warships appeared nearby, and turned their weapons to §H[Root.GetName]§!!"
